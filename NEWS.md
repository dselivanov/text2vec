# text2vec 0.6.5 (2023-10-16)
- fix test discovered with `Matrix==1.6-2` release

# text2vec 0.6.4 (2023-02-15)
- update dependency `Matrix>=1.5-2`, fixes #338

# text2vec 0.6.2 (2022-09-11)
- removed test which is not needed with Matrix package v 1.5

# text2vec 0.6
1. 2019-12-17
    *  **breaking change** - removed construction of a vocabulary in parallel on windows
    * use `rsparse` package for SVD and GloVe factorizations
    * updated RWMD implementation (hopefully bug free)
1. 2018-09-10
    *  **breaking change** - changed IDF formula - see #280 for details.
1. 2018-05-28
    * Added `postag_lemma_tokenizer()` (wrapper around `udpipe::udpipe_annotate`). Can be used as a drop-in replacement for more simple tokenizers in text2vec. 
1. 2018-05-25
    * Made `combine_vocabularies()` part of public API - see #260 for details.
1. 2018-05-10
    * Added `coherence()` function for comprehensive coherence metrics. Thanks to Manuel Bickel ( @manuelbickel ) for conrtibution.
1. 2018-05-02
    * Fixed bug LSA model - document embeddings calculated as left singular vectors multiplied by singular values (not square root of values as before). Thanks to Sloane Simmons ( @singularperturbation )
    * Now `fit_transform` and `transform` methods in LDA model produce same results. Thanks to @jiunsiew for reporting. Also now LDA has `n_iter_inference` parameter. It controls number of the samples from converged distribution for document-topic inference. This leads to more robust document-topic probabilities (reduced variance). Default value is 10.
1. 2018-01-17
    * more numerically robust PMI, LFMD - thanks to @andland. Also adds iteration number `iter` to `collocation_stat`. `iter` shows iteration number when collocation stats (and counters) were calculated.

# text2vec 0.5.1 [2018-01-10]

1. 2018-01-10
    * removed rank* columns from `collocation_stat` - were never used internally. Users can easily calculate ranks themselves
1. 2018-01-09
    * Added Bi-Normal Separation transformation, thanks to Pavel Shashkin ( @pshashk )
    * Added Dunning's log-likelihood ratio for collocations, thanks to Chris Lee ( @Chrisss93 )
    * Early stopping for collocations learning
1. 2017-12-18
    * fixed several bugs #219 #217 #205
    * decreased number of dependencies - no more `magrittr`, `uuid`, `tokenizers`
    * removed distributed LDA which didn't work correctly
1. 2017-10-18
    * Now tokenization is based on [tokenizers](https://github.com/ropensci/tokenizers) and **THE** [stringi](https://github.com/gagolews/stringi) packages.
    * models API follow [mlapi](https://github.com/dselivanov/mlapi) package. No API changes on `text2vec` side - we just put abstract `scikit-learn`-like classes to a separate package in order to make them more reusable.

# text2vec 0.5.0

1. 2017-06-12
    * Add additional filters to `prune_vocabulary` - filter by document counts
    * Clean up LSA, fixed transform method. Added option to use randomized SVD algorithm from `irlba`.
1. 2017-05-17
    * Imrove `dist2` performamce for RWMD - incorporate ideas from [gensim PR discussion](https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/pull/800#issuecomment-260743822).
1. 2017-05-17
    * **API breaking change** - vocabulary format change - now plain `data.frame` with meta-information in attributes (stopwords, ngram, number of docs, etc).
1. 2017-03-25
    * No more rely on RcppModules
    * **API breaking change** - removed `lda_c` from formats in DTM construction
    * added `ifiles_parallel`, `itoken_parallel` high-level functions for parallel computing
    * **API breaking change**  `chunks_numer` parameter renamed to `n_chunks`
1. 2017-01-02 
    * **API breaking change** - removed `create_corpus` from public API, moved co-occurence related optons to `create_tcm` from vecorizers
    * add ability to add custom weights for co-occurence statistics calculations
1. 2016-12-30 
    * Noticeable **speedup** (**1.5x**) and even more noticeable improvement on memory usage (**2x** less!) for `create_dtm`, `create_tcm` . Now package relies on [sparsepp](https://github.com/dselivanov/sparsepp) library for underlying hash maps.
1. 2016-10-30 
    * Collocations -  detection of multi-word phrases using differend heuristics - *PMI, gensim, LFMD*.
1. 2016-10-20 
    * Fixed bug in `as.lda_c()` function

# text2vec 0.4.0

# text2vec 0.3.0

1. 2016-01-13 fix for #46, thanks to @[buhrmann](https://github.com/buhrmann) for reporting 
1. 2016-01-16 format of vocabulary changed.
    * do not keep `doc_proportions`. see #52.
    * add `stop_words` argument to `prune_vocabulary`. signature also was changed.
1. 2016-01-17 fix for #51. if iterator over tokens returns list with names, these names will be:
    * stored as `attr(corpus, 'ids')`
    * rownames in dtm
    * names for dtm list in `lda_c` format
1. 2016-02-02 high level function for corpus and vocabulary construction.
    * construction of vocabulary from list of `itoken`. 
    * construction of dtm from list of `itoken`. 
1. 2016-02-10 rename transformers
    * now all transformers starts with `transform_*` - more intuitive + simpler usage with autocompletion
1. 2016-03-29 (accumulated since 2016-02-10)
    * rename `vocabulary` to `create_vocabulary`.
    * new functions `create_dtm`, `create_tcm`.
    * All core functions are able to benefit from multicore machines (user have to register parallel backend themselves)
    * Fix for progress bars. Now they are able to reach 100% and ticks increased after computation.
    * `ids` argument to `itoken`. Simplifies assignement of ids to rows of DTM
    * `create_vocabulary` now can handle `stopwords` 
    * see all updates [here](https://github.com/dselivanov/text2vec/milestones/0.3)
1. 2016-03-30 more robust `split_into()` util.
