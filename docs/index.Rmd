You've just discovered **[text2vec](https://github.com/dselivanov/text2vec)**!

**text2vec** is an R package which provides an efficient framework with a concise API for text analysis and natural language processing (NLP). 

Goals which we aimed to achieve as a result of development of `text2vec`:

* **Concise** - expose as few functions as possible
* **Consistent** - expose unified interfaces, no need to explore new interface for each task
* **Flexible** - allow to easily solve complex tasks
* **Fast** - maximize efficiency per single thread, transparently scale to multiple threads on multicore machines
* **Memory efficient** - use streams and iterators, not keep data in RAM if possible

See [API](api.html) section for details.

# Performance

*Author of the package is a little bit obsessed about efficiency.*

This package is efficient because it is carefully written in C++, which also means that text2vec is memory friendly. Some parts (such as GloVe) are fully parallelized using the excellent [RcppParallel](http://rcppcore.github.io/RcppParallel/) package. This means that the word embeddings are computed in parallel on OS X, Linux, Windows, and even Solaris (x86) without any additional tuning or tricks.

Other emrassingly parallel tasks (such as vectorization) can use any parallel backend which supports [foreach](https://cran.r-project.org/package=foreach) package. They can achieve near-linear scalability with number of available cores. 

Finally, a streaming API means that  users do not have to load all the data into RAM.
