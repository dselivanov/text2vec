#' Coherence metrics for topic models
#'
#' Given a topic model with topics represented as ordered term lists, the coherence may be used to assess the quality of individual topics.
#' This function is an implmentation of several of the numerous possible metrics for such kind of assessments.
#' Coherence calculation is sensitive to the content of the reference \code{tcm} that is used for evaluation
#' and that may be created with different parameter settings. Please refer to the details section (or refrence section) for information
#' on typical combinations of metric and type of \code{tcm}. For more general information on measuring coherence
#' a starting point is given in the reference section.
#'
#' The currently implemented coherence \code{metrics} are described below including a description of the
#' content type of the \code{tcm} that showed good performance in combination with a specific metric.  \cr
#' For details on how to create \code{tcm} see the example section.  \cr
#' For details on performance of metrics see the resources in the reference section
#' that served for definition of standard settings for individual metrics.  \cr
#' Note that depending on the use case, still, different settings than the standard settings for creation of \code{tcm} may be reasonable.  \cr
#' Note that for all currently implemented metrics the \code{tcm} is reduced to the top word space on basis of the terms in \code{x}.
#'
#' Considering the use case of finding the optimum number of topics among several models with different metrics,
#' calculating the mean score over all topics and normalizing this mean coherence scores from different metrics
#' might be considered for direct comparison.
#'
#' Each metric usually opts for a different optimum number of topics. From initial experience it may be assumed
#' that logratio, pmi and nmpi usually opt for smaller numbers, whereas the other metrics rather tend to propose higher numbers.
#'
#' Implemented metrics:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item "mean_logratio"  \cr
#'                    The logarithmic ratio is calculated as \cr
#'                    \code{log(smooth + tcm[x,y]) - log(tcm[y,y])},  \cr
#'                    where x and y are term index pairs from a "preceeding" term index combination.  \cr
#'                    Given the indices c(1,2,3), combinations are \code{list(c(2,1), c(3,1), c(3,2))}.  \cr
#' \cr
#'                    The \code{tcm} should represent the boolean term co-occurrence (internally the actual counts are used)
#'                    in the original documents and, therefore, is an intrinsic metric in the standard use case.  \cr
#' \cr
#'                    This metric is similar to the UMass metric, however, with a smaller smoothing constant by default
#'                    and using the mean for aggregation instead of the sum.  \cr
#'
#'   \item "mean_pmi" \cr
#'                    The pointwise mutual information is calucalted as  \cr
#'                    \code{log2((tcm[x,y]/n_doc_tcm) + smooth) - log2(tcm[x,x]/n_doc_tcm) - log2(tcm[y,y]/n_doc_tcm)},  \cr
#'                    where x and y are term index pairs from an arbitrary term index combination  \cr
#'                    that subsets the lower or upper triangle of \code{tcm}, e.g. "preceeding".  \cr
#' \cr
#'                    The \code{tcm} should represent term co-occurrences within a boolean sliding window of size 10 (internally probabilities are used)
#'                    in an external reference corpus and, therefore, is an extrinsic metric in the standard use case.  \cr
#' \cr
#'                    This metric is similar to the UCI metric, however, with a smaller smoothing constant by default
#'                    and using the mean for aggregation instead of the sum.
#'
#'   \item "mean_npmi" \cr
#'                    Similar (in terms of all parameter settings, etc.) to "mean_pmi" metric
#'                    but using the normalized pmi instead, which is calucalated as \cr
#'                    \code{(log2((tcm[x,y]/n_doc_tcm) + smooth) - log2(tcm[x,x]/n_doc_tcm) - log2(tcm[y,y]/n_doc_tcm)) / -log2((tcm[x,y]/n_doc_tcm) + smooth)},  \cr
#' \cr
#'                    This metric may perform better than the simpler pmi metric.
#'
#'   \item "mean_difference" \cr
#'                    The difference is calculated as  \cr
#'                    \code{tcm[x,y]/twcm[x,x] - (tcm[y,y]/n_tcm_windows)},  \cr
#'                    where x and y are term index pairs from a "preceeding" term index combination.  \cr
#'                    Given the indices c(1,2,3), combinations are \code{list(c(1,2), c(1,3), c(2,3))}.  \cr
#' \cr
#'                    The \code{tcm} should represent the boolean term co-occurrence (internally probabilities are used)
#'                    in the original documents and, therefore, is an intrinsic metric in the standard use case.
#'
#'   \item "mean_npmi_cosim" \cr
#'                    First, the npmi of an individual top word with each of the top words is calculated as in "mean_mpmi". \cr
#'                    This resulta in a vector of npmi values for each top word. \cr
#'                    On this basis, the cosine similarity between each pair of vectors is calculated. \cr
#' \cr
#'                    The \code{tcm} should represent term co-occurrences within a boolean sliding window of size 5 (internally probabilities are used)
#'                    in an external reference corpus and, therefore, is an extrinsic metric in the standard use case.  \cr
#'
#'   \item "mean_npmi_cosim2" \cr
#'                    First, a vector of npmi values for each top word is calculated as in "mean_npmi_cosim". \cr
#'                    On this basis, the cosine similarity between each vector and the sum of all vectors is calculated
#'                    (instead of the similarity between each pair). \cr
#' \cr
#'                    The \code{tcm} should represent term co-occurrences within a boolean sliding window of size 110 (internally probabilities are used)
#'                    in an external reference corpus and, therefore, is an extrinsic metric in the standard use case.  \cr

#' @param x A \code{character matrix} with the top terms per topic (each column represents one topic),
#'          e.g., as created by \code{get_top_words()}.
#'          Terms of \code{x} have to be ranked per topic starting with rank 1 in row 1.
#' @param tcm The term co-occurrence matrix, e.g, a \code{Matrix::sparseMatrix} or \code{base::matrix},
#'            serving as the reference to calculate coherence metrics.

#GENERAL LOGIC OF THE CODE
#The given reference tcm that may be created in different ways (e.g., extrinsic vs. intrinsic, or binary counts vs. actual counts)
#is reduced to the top word space via unique terms found in x.

#Depending on the needs of the metric the count matrix is turned into probability matrix
#by dividing by n_doc_tcm, i.e.,number of actual docs or term windows..

#Considering a loop approach (used by other packages) for creating term index combinations for the calculation,
#different subsets of indices may be built and accessed (see, e.g., textmineR::CalcProbCoherence)
#E.g. one index with all succeeding indices or with all preceeding indices.
#For c(1,2,3,4) succeeding combinations would be c(1,2), (1,3), c(1,4), c(2,3), c(2,4), c(3,4)
#and preceeding combinations would be c(2,1), c(3, 2), c(3, 1), c(4, 3), c(4, 2), c(4, 1)
#Using a vectorized approach, these combinations represent the lower or upper triangle of the tcm.
#At the first sight, combinations look all the same since tcm is symmetric.
#However, when, e.g., starting to divide by diagonal values (marginal probability),
#it makes a difference if we take the first index as leading index and do
#p[c(1,2)]/p[1,1] for succeeding subset or p[c(2,1)]/p[2,2] for preceeding subset.

#The following general considerations are important for vectorized calculations:
#diagonal of tcm represents marginal probabilities, hence, the expression that might be used in a loop approach
#p[x,y]/(p[x,x] * p[y,y])
#translates to
#d = diag(res)
#res = res/d
#res = t(apply(res, 1, function(x) x/d))
#Considering the type of index subsets, hence, which subset of tcm is taken our current understanding is that
#tcm should be left as is after reducing to top word space and then
#for succeeding subset: do calculations with top term indices as is and take upper.triangle
#for preceeding subset: sort indices of top term indices decreasingly and take upper.triangle

#After calculation of scores for individual term/index combinations, those are aggregated into a coherence score for one topic.
